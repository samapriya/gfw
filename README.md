The Global Fishing Watch map is the first open-access online platform for visualization and analysis of vessel-based human activity at sea, including fishing activity, encounters between vessels, night light vessel detection and vessel presence. This tool is designed to help interact programmatically with the [Global Fishing Watch data](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/) and is not based on any official API so expect features to break once in a while.
